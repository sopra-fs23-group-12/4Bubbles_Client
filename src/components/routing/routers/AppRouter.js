/**
 * Main router of your application.
 * In the following class, different routes are rendered. In our case, there is a Login Route with matches the path "/login"
 * and another Router that matches the route "/Game.scss".
 * The main difference between these two routes is the following:
 * /login renders another component without any sub-route
 * /Game.scss renders a Router that contains other sub-routes that render in turn other react components
